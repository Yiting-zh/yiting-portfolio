      <p className="body-regular">Hi, Iâ€™m Yiting ðŸ˜ºðŸŒ¿ <br /><br />A front-end developer with a UX backgroundâ€”curious, creative, and driven by the joy of building.<br /><br />My journey started in UX design, where I loved turning user needs into meaningful digital experiences. But the more I worked with developers, the more I realized I didnâ€™t want to stop at designâ€”I wanted to build things myself. <br /><br />That curiosity led me to front-end development. I began learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I was hooked. It felt empowering to bring my ideas to life through code and create experiences that are both functional and beautiful.<br /><br />Now, Iâ€™m focused on becoming a developer who not only thinks about how things look and feelâ€”but also how they work.<br /><br />With my UX mindset and technical skills, Iâ€™m ready to build better products from the inside out.</p>
